# Fix: Match Creation Now Uses Calculated Ratings with Tournament Points

## 🐛 Bug Discovered

When creating matches, the system was using **base player ratings** (e.g., 1674) instead of **calculated ratings with tournament points** (e.g., 2566.7).

### Evidence from Console Logs

```
✅ CORRECT - Classifica Tab:
Andrea Paris: rating=2566.7, baseRating=1500

✅ CORRECT - ClubContext calculatedRatingsById:
Andrea Paris: 2566.7

❌ WRONG - CreaPartita Form:
Y3o7UxPqUPRZSlLM3DA9sKr2SEB2: 1674 (base rating only)

❌ WRONG - Match Created:
Updated rating for Y3o7UxPqUPRZSlLM3DA9sKr2SEB2: 1447 → 1494 (+47)
(Should have started from 2566.7, not 1447)
```

### Root Cause

1. `ClubContext` correctly calculates `calculatedRatingsById` with tournament points
2. **BUT** `calculatedRatingsById` was NOT exported from ClubContext
3. `MatchesPage` couldn't access it and used only `computeClubRanking(players, matches)` without tournament data
4. `CreaPartita` received `rankingData` with base ratings only
5. Match creation used wrong ratings

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Export Calculated Ratings from ClubContext

**File:** `src/contexts/ClubContext.jsx`

```javascript
const value = {
  clubId,
  courts,
  players,
  matches,
  club,
  loading,
  leaderboard,
  playersLoaded,
  matchesLoaded,
  loadPlayers,
  loadMatches,
  addCourt,
  updateCourt,
  deleteCourt,
  selectClub,
  exitClub,
  hasClub,
  playersById,
  loadingStates,
  addPlayer,
  updatePlayer,
  deletePlayer,
  isUserInstructor,
  calculatedRatingsById, // ✅ NEW: Export calculated ratings with tournament points
  tournamentMatches, // ✅ NEW: Export tournament matches for ranking calculation
};
```

### 2. Use Calculated Ratings in MatchesPage

**File:** `src/pages/MatchesPage.jsx`

**Import calculated ratings:**

```javascript
const {
  clubId,
  loadPlayers,
  players,
  playersLoaded,
  loadMatches,
  matches,
  matchesLoaded,
  calculatedRatingsById, // ✅ Get calculated ratings with tournament points
  tournamentMatches, // ✅ Get tournament matches for complete ranking
} = useClub();
```

**Build rankingData with calculated ratings:**

```javascript
const rankingData = useMemo(() => {
  if (!players.length) {
    return { players: [], matches: [] };
  }

  // 🎯 Arricchisci i giocatori con i rating calcolati (base + punti torneo)
  const playersWithCalculatedRatings = players.map((p) => ({
    ...p,
    rating: calculatedRatingsById?.[p.id] || p.rating, // ✅ Usa rating con punti torneo
  }));

  console.log('🎾 [MatchesPage] Ranking data preparato:');
  console.log('📊 Players:', playersWithCalculatedRatings.length);
  console.log('🏆 Sample ratings (top 3):');
  playersWithCalculatedRatings.slice(0, 3).forEach((p) => {
    console.log(`  ${p.name}: ${p.rating} (base: ${p.baseRating || 'N/A'})`);
  });

  return {
    players: playersWithCalculatedRatings,
    matches: [...matches, ...(tournamentMatches || [])],
  };
}, [players, matches, tournamentMatches, calculatedRatingsById]);
```

## 📊 How It Works Now

### Data Flow (CORRECT)

```
1. ClubContext calculates ratings:
   Player Base Rating: 1500
   + Tournament Points: +1066.7
   = Calculated Rating: 2566.7

2. ClubContext exports calculatedRatingsById:
   {
     "Y3o7UxPqUPRZSlLM3DA9sKr2SEB2": 2566.7 ✅
   }

3. MatchesPage enriches players:
   players.map(p => ({
     ...p,
     rating: calculatedRatingsById[p.id] || p.rating // 2566.7 ✅
   }))

4. CreaPartita receives rankingData:
   rankingData.players = [
     { id: "Y3o7...", name: "Andrea Paris", rating: 2566.7 } ✅
   ]

5. Match creation uses correct rating:
   getRating("Y3o7...") → 2566.7 ✅
```

### Before (WRONG)

```
1. ClubContext calculates ratings: 2566.7 ✅
2. NOT exported ❌
3. MatchesPage uses computeClubRanking(players, matches) ❌
   - Missing tournamentMatches
   - Missing leaderboard
   - Returns base ratings only: 1674
4. CreaPartita receives wrong data: 1674 ❌
5. Match created with base rating: 1674 ❌
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Expected Console Output

When creating a match, you should now see:

```
🎾 [MatchesPage] Ranking data preparato:
📊 Players: 20
🏆 Sample ratings (top 3):
  Andrea Paris: 2566.7 (base: 1500)
  Andrea Di Vito: 2562.7 (base: 1500)
  Angelo Di Mattia: 2094.5 (base: 2000)

🎾 Live ratings: {
  a1: 'Y3o7UxPqUPRZSlLM3DA9sKr2SEB2: 2566.7',  ✅ CORRECT (was 1674)
  a2: 'kb1xbwle: 2562.7',                      ✅ CORRECT (was 1670)
  b1: 'v8h4dgdh: 2364.9',                      ✅ CORRECT (was 2064)
  b2: '70xe0dha: 2094.5'                       ✅ CORRECT (was 1874)
}
```

### Test Steps

1. **Open browser console**
2. **Go to Classifica tab** → Note Andrea Paris rating (e.g., 2566.7)
3. **Go to Matches tab** → Check console for "🎾 [MatchesPage] Ranking data preparato"
4. **Select players** → Check "🎾 Live ratings" shows same values as Classifica
5. **Create match** → Verify ratings used match Classifica values

- ✅ `src/contexts/ClubContext.jsx` - Exports calculatedRatingsById and tournamentMatches
- ✅ `src/pages/MatchesPage.jsx` - Uses calculated ratings for rankingData
- 📄 `src/features/crea/CreaPartita.jsx` - Receives correct rankingData (no changes needed)
- 📄 `src/pages/ClassificaPage.jsx` - Reference implementation (already correct)

## 🎯 Impact

### What Changed

- ✅ Regular matches now use calculated ratings (base + tournament points)
- ✅ Match Elo calculations start from correct baseline
- ✅ Consistent rating display across Classifica and Matches tabs

### What Stayed the Same

- ✅ Tournament match generation (already used getCurrentPlayersRanking)
- ✅ Rating calculation algorithm (computeClubRanking)
- ✅ Leaderboard system

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. ✅ Test match creation with tournament players
2. ✅ Verify correct ratings are used in console logs
3. ⏳ Remove debug console.log statements after verification
4. ⏳ Test build: `npm run build`
5. ⏳ Commit changes: "fix: use calculated ratings with tournament points in match creation"

## 📌 Key Insight

The issue wasn't in `CreaPartita` or the rating calculation algorithm. The problem was **data not being passed** from ClubContext to MatchesPage. By exporting `calculatedRatingsById` and using it to enrich the players array, matches now correctly use ratings that include tournament points.
