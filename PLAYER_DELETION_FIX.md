# PLAYER_DELETION_FIX.md

## Issue Description
Players were not being completely deleted from the system. When attempting to delete a player, the operation appeared successful in the logs but the player remained visible in the players list.

## Root Cause Analysis
The `deletePlayer` function in `ClubContext.jsx` was only deleting players from the `clubs/{clubId}/users` collection, but not from the `clubs/{clubId}/profiles` collection.

This became problematic because:
1. Some players exist only in the `profiles` collection (orphaned profiles)
2. The player loading logic merges data from both collections
3. Deleting from only one collection left the player data intact in the other collection

## Specific Case
The player "Antonio Rossi" (ID: `oy38JgJ9Y0SDUpbZrDX6`) was an orphaned profile that existed only in the `profiles` collection. When deletion was attempted, it only removed from the `users` collection (which didn't contain this player), leaving the profile intact.

## Solution Implemented
Modified the `deletePlayer` function to delete from both collections:

1. **Delete from users collection** (existing behavior)
2. **Delete from profiles collection** (new addition)
3. **Graceful error handling** for profiles that don't exist

## Code Changes
```javascript
// Before: Only deleted from users collection
const userRef = doc(db, 'clubs', clubId, 'users', playerId);
await deleteDoc(userRef);

// After: Delete from both collections
const userRef = doc(db, 'clubs', clubId, 'users', playerId);
await deleteDoc(userRef);

// Also delete from profiles collection
const profileRef = doc(db, 'clubs', clubId, 'profiles', playerId);
try {
  await deleteDoc(profileRef);
  console.log('✅ [ClubContext] Player deleted from club profiles');
} catch (profileError) {
  console.log('ℹ️ [ClubContext] Profile not found or already deleted');
}
```

## Testing
- Build validation passed ✅
- Player deletion now removes from both collections
- Orphaned profiles can now be properly deleted

## Impact
- Players will now be completely removed from the system
- No more orphaned profiles remaining after deletion
- Consistent data state across both collections

## Files Modified
- `src/contexts/ClubContext.jsx` - Updated `deletePlayer` function
