## 🎯 Next Steps: Tournament Statistics Testing

### What to Test
1. **Create/Select a Tournament** with completed matches
2. **Press "Applica Punti"** (Apply Points)
3. **Open Player Statistics** tab
4. **Check Browser Console** for these debug logs:

#### Checkpoint 1: When Pressing "Applica Punti"
Look for logs starting with `🎯 [loadTournamentMatchesForStats]`:
```
🎯 [loadTournamentMatchesForStats] Loading matches for tournament <ID>
   ✅ Player <ID>: X matches da salvare in matchDetails
   📝 Saving entry for <ID>: matchDetails=X items
```

If these appear → Tournament data IS being saved ✅
If NOT → Tournament aggregation not working ❌

#### Checkpoint 2: When Opening Statistics Tab
Look for logs starting with `📖 [champEntries useEffect]`:
```
📖 [champEntries useEffect] Subscribing to leaderboard/<PLAYER_ID>/entries
📖 [champEntries] Received N entries
   First entry keys: type, tournamentId, matchDetails, ...
   First entry matchDetails: X
```

If `N > 0` and `matchDetails > 0` → Data IS stored ✅
If `N = 0` → Nothing saved yet ❌
If `matchDetails = undefined` → Field not saved properly ❌

#### Checkpoint 3: Statistics Calculation
Look for logs starting with `🏆` and `📊`:
```
🏆 [StatisticheGiocatore] champEntries encontrados: N
   📋 Entry: tournamentId=..., matchDetails=X
   ✅ Agregando X matches de torneo
📊 [StatisticheGiocatore] Total matches: Z (regular: X, torneo: Y)
```

If `torneo: Y` is > 0 → Tournament matches combined ✅
If `torneo: 0` → No tournament matches in calculation ❌

#### Checkpoint 4: Advanced Stats Calculation
Look for logs starting with `🎯 [advancedStats]`:
```
🎯 [advancedStats] Player <ID>: N matches from total M
```

If appears → Stats computed with combined data ✅
If NOT → Stats not running ❌

## 📋 Testing Workflow

### Phase 1: Setup
```
1. Go to Tournaments tab
2. Select or create a tournament with completed matches
3. Ensure tournament has:
   - Multiple teams
   - Completed matches (with scores)
```

### Phase 2: Data Aggregation
```
1. Open Admin Panel → Apply Points
2. Press "Applica Punti" button
3. Open Browser Console (F12)
4. RECORD: Do you see the 🎯 logs?
```

### Phase 3: Data Reading
```
1. Go to Statistics tab for a player
2. Open Browser Console (F12)
3. RECORD: Do you see the 📖 and 🏆 logs?
4. RECORD: What are the numbers?
   - champEntries found: ?
   - matchDetails per entry: ?
   - Total matches (regular vs tournament): ?
```

### Phase 4: Verification
```
1. Check if statistics numbers changed
2. Check if they now include tournament match data
3. Verify storico partite DOESN'T show tournament matches
4. REPORT: Any issues or unexpected behavior
```
