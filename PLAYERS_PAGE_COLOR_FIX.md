# Players Page Color Palette Fix - Completed ✅

## Overview
Fixed hardcoded color classes in the Players CRM page (`/club/sporting-cat/players`) and all related components to use the unified theme token system. This ensures consistent dark theme appearance after removing the light/dark theme switcher.

## Issues Fixed
The players page had remnant hardcoded Tailwind color classes (e.g., `text-blue-400`, `text-green-600`, `text-purple-400`) that were designed for the old light/dark theme system. These colors didn't adapt properly to the dark-only theme.

- `T.accentSuccess` - Green accent for success states
- `T.accentWarning` - Orange accent for warnings
- `T.cardBg` - Card background color
- `T.border` - Border color
- `T.input` - Input field styles
