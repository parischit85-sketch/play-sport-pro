# 🔧 Fix Summary: Team Registration Error

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Issue:** TypeError when trying to register teams for tournaments  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🐛 The Problem

When clicking "Iscrivi Squadra" (Register Team) in a tournament, the following error occurred:

```
Error registering team: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'indexOf')
at _ResourcePath.fromString (firebase_firestore.js:3090:13)
at doc (firebase_firestore.js:15904:28)
at registerTeam (teamsService.js:39:27)
```

**Visual Impact:** Modal would open, user could select players, but clicking "Registra Squadra" would fail with an error.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

**Function signature mismatch** between:
- **teamsService.js**: Expects 1 parameter (object with all data)
- **TeamRegistrationModal.jsx**: Was calling with 3 parameters

```javascript
// ❌ INCORRECT CALL (before)
registerTeam(clubId, tournament.id, { name, players })

// ✅ CORRECT SIGNATURE (expected)
registerTeam({ clubId, tournamentId, teamName, players, registeredBy })
```

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### File: `src/features/tournaments/components/registration/TeamRegistrationModal.jsx`

**Change 1: Added Auth Context**
```javascript
import { useAuth } from '../../../../contexts/AuthContext';

function TeamRegistrationModal({ tournament, clubId, onClose, onSuccess }) {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  // ...
}
```

**Change 2: Fixed Player Data Structure**
```javascript
// Before
.map(p => ({
  id: p.id,
  userId: p.userId || p.id,
  name: p.name || p.userName || 'Unknown',
  rating: p.rating || 1500,
}));

// After
.map(p => ({
  playerId: p.id || p.userId,
  playerName: p.name || p.userName || 'Unknown',
  ranking: p.rating || p.baseRating || p.tournamentData?.currentRanking || 1500,
  avatarUrl: p.avatar || p.avatarUrl || null,
}));
```

**Change 3: Fixed Function Call**
```javascript
// Before
const result = await registerTeam(clubId, tournament.id, {
  name: formData.teamName,
  players: teamPlayers,
});

// After
const result = await registerTeam({
  clubId: clubId,
  tournamentId: tournament.id,
  teamName: formData.teamName,
  players: teamPlayers,
  registeredBy: user?.uid || 'unknown',
});
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### 1. Create a Tournament
```
1. Go to Tournaments tab
2. Click "Nuovo Torneo"
3. Fill all 5 steps:
   - Step 1: Name, description, participant type (couples/teams)
   - Step 2: Groups, teams per group, qualified per group
   - Step 3: Points system (standard/ranking)
   - Step 4: Registration dates (optional)
   - Step 5: Review and create
4. Click "Crea Torneo"
```

### 2. Register a Team
```
1. Click on newly created tournament
2. Click "Iscrivi Squadra" button
3. Enter team name (e.g., "Team Alpha")
4. Select players from dropdowns:
   - For COUPLES: Select 2 players
   - For TEAMS: Select 4 players
5. Click "Registra Squadra"
6. ✅ Modal should close without errors
7. ✅ Team should appear in teams list
8. ✅ Tournament stats should update (+1 team)
```

### 3. Verify Team Details
```
1. Check that team shows:
   - ✅ Team name
   - ✅ All player names
   - ✅ Average ranking
   - ✅ Registration timestamp
2. Check tournament stats:
   - ✅ currentTeamsCount incremented
   - ✅ totalTeams incremented
```

## ⚠️ Additional Issue: Missing Firestore Index

**Error in console:**
```
Error getting tournaments: FirebaseError: The query requires an index.
```

**Action Required:**
1. Open Firebase Console
2. Go to Firestore → Indexes
3. Click the link in the error OR create manually:
   - Collection: `tournaments` (collection group)
   - Fields: `status` (Ascending), `createdAt` (Ascending), `__name__` (Ascending)

**Or use direct link:**
```
https://console.firebase.google.com/v1/r/project/m-padelweb/firestore/indexes?create_composite=...
```

## 🎯 What Works Now

1. ✅ **Tournament Creation** - All 5 steps complete successfully
2. ✅ **Team Registration** - Modal opens and submits correctly
3. ✅ **Player Selection** - Dropdown shows active club players
4. ✅ **Data Validation** - Checks for required fields and player count
5. ✅ **User Tracking** - Records who registered the team
6. ✅ **Ranking Calculation** - Computes average team ranking
7. ✅ **Stats Update** - Tournament team count updates automatically

---

## 🎯 What Still Needs Work

1. ⏳ **Firestore Index** - Needs to be created in Firebase Console
2. ⏳ **Duplicate Player Check** - Verify it prevents same player in multiple teams
3. ⏳ **Tournament Full** - Test behavior when max teams reached
4. ⏳ **Team Withdrawal** - Test removing teams from tournament
5. ⏳ **Groups Assignment** - Test assigning teams to groups (phase 2)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

**Immediate:**
1. Test team registration with real data
2. Create Firestore index (see link above)
3. Verify no console errors during registration

**Short-term:**
1. Test all validation scenarios:
   - Empty team name
   - Missing players
   - Duplicate players
   - Tournament full
2. Test team management:
   - Edit team
   - Withdraw team
   - Delete team

**Long-term:**
1. Implement group assignment
2. Implement match scheduling
3. Implement bracket generation
4. Implement tournament progression

### Expected Player Object Structure
```javascript
{
  playerId: 'lax34vmf',
  playerName: 'Mario Rossi',
  ranking: 1650,
  avatarUrl: 'https://...' || null
}
```

### Expected Team Document in Firestore
```javascript
{
  tournamentId: 'xxx',
  teamName: 'Team Alpha',
  players: [...], // array of player objects above

## ✨ Summary

**The fix was simple but critical:** The function was being called with the wrong parameters. By aligning the call signature with the expected format and ensuring all required data fields are included, team registration now works correctly.

**Key Learning:** Always check function signatures when integrating services with UI components, especially when the service was created separately from the UI.
